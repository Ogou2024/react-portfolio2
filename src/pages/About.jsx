           <p>I am an engineer, web developer, educator, polyglot, and an philanthropist. 
  I grew up in Haiti, "Laplén" - in a small town called "Karade" inside a small village called "Gran Chimen". 
  Mathematics and languages saved my life. 
  During my career experience, I have worked with top smart people at Google, Lockheed Martin, and other major technology companies. 
  Also, I have visited and lived in about 25 countries. With this educational platform, 
  I hope one day I can give back all the knowledge that I was given to my Haitian people.</p>

<p>My mission - A virtual choice for Haitians to have more access to education.</p>

<p>My vision - is to create sustainable, affordable, and easy access to education for all future generations of Haitians. We aspire to be educators in developing revolutionary techniques in teaching and learning skills that improve education in Haiti.

</p>
<p>Our key goals – affordability, easy access, essential and extraordinary content, improvement of education in our country.</p>
